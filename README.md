### What I learned

This is a solution to the beginner level challenge and is fairly easy. However, on attempting this challenge, I got to know how to center a div vertically. Centering a div has been a very ppopular topic in HTML and CSS.
There are a number of to center vertically but Flexbox makes it very easy(in my opinion). I just used a div inside main and using flex display on the main tag. Flexbox also makes it easy in centering it horizontally.



```html
<main>
    <div class="content">
      ...
    </div>
</main>
```
```css
main {
    margin: auto;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    justify-content: center;
    text-align: center;
    align-items: center;
    min-height: 100vh;
}
```
